# hex that color

A soon-to-be built minigame/web app thing where you guess a hex value

Mostly based off of my years of personal experience dabbling in digital illustration and web design, and some very small fiddling with the idea of playing with color (see also: [this codepen](https://codepen.io/shoelaces/pen/dRdEqv) I had made while back)

Loosely based off of [Andrew Yang's what the hex](http://yizzle.com/whatthehex/) which was the first thing I found on Google while searching for the phrase "guess the hex", and the site "name that blue" which had users guess which company a shade of blue corresponded to.

~~and that's all the market research I did for this woops~~

## Possible features

- [ ] Some sort of quantifiable score for accuracy ( [1](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/107318/formula-for-color-contrast-between-text-and-background)]
- [ ] Or if not a quantifiable score, some sort of threshold that 
- [ ] Dynamic updates for colors (i.e. as you type in a hex value, your "answer" to the "question" changes then and there)
- [ ] uh
- [ ] Levels?
